# Retrieval-Augmented-Generation-RAG-
**Project Title:**
**LlamaSearch: Intelligent Document Exploration**

**Project Details**
**Project Description**
- This project demonstrates a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application** that leverages advanced AI models &
tools for intelligent document querying and summarization. It utilizes `LangChain, LLAMA3-70B, Groq API, Chroma DB, and PyPDFLoader` to enable efficient PDF processing, vector database creation, and retrieval-augmented question-answering. The system is designed for analyzing large documents like PDFs and extracting insightful responses dynamically.

**Key Features**
 - **PDF Document Loading and Preprocessing:**
   -  Used PyPDFLoader and UnstructuredFileLoader to load and process PDF documents efficiently.
   -  Implemented text extraction, chunking, and preprocessing using CharacterTextSplitter for optimal vector 
    embedding.
 - **Vector Database Integration:**
   -  Created a Chroma vector database to store document embeddings for fast and scalable querying.
   - Employed HuggingFace Embeddings for generating robust document embeddings.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):**
  - Leveraged Groq LLM (LLAMA3-70B) for intelligent and contextual response generation.
  - Built a retrieval-based QA system using LangChainâ€™s RetrievalQA to query documents and provide accurate answers.- 
-  **Real-Time Summarization and Q&A:**
   - Integrated a seamless pipeline for summarizing and answering questions based on the input PDF using ChatGroq 
    models.
- **API and Library Integration:**
  - Utilized Groq API for LLM integration and Chroma DB for embedding persistence.
  - Implemented error handling for smooth and scalable document analysis.
 
- **Key Contributions**
  - **Developed a Retrieval-Augmented Question-Answering System:** Designed a pipeline to query large PDF documents 
    and retrieve meaningful insights.
  - **Implemented Vectorized Search:** Created a Chroma database for storing and searching document embeddings 
   efficiently.
  - **Integrated Advanced AI Models:** Utilized LLAMA3-70B via Groq API for high-quality language understanding and 
    summarization.
  - **Text Preprocessing and Chunking:** Processed large documents into manageable chunks for embedding and retrieval.
  - **Streamlined Summarization and Q&A:** Designed a system to provide real-time responses to user queries based on 
     PDF content.
